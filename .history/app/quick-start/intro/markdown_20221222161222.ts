# Creating your first atom

  Jotai atoms are small isolated pieces of state. Ideally, one atom contains very small data.

So here's how you create your first atom.

~~~js
import { atom } from 'jotai';
const counter = atom(0);
~~~

It is as simple to use as Reactâ€™s integrated useState hook, but all state is globally accessible.

The atom we created is to be passed to useState with the useAtom which returns an array of size 2, where the 1st element is a value and the 2nd element is a function, to set the value of the atom.
